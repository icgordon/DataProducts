Final version of the R files for the Shiny app and for the Rpres presentation.

You can find the published slides at http://rpubs.com/icgordon/87068 and the shiny app at
http://icgordon.shinyapps.io/DataProducts

There may be some display problems with IE on lower resolution monitors. In testing, I have
noticed that the up/down buttons in the IQ text box do not appear. Also, it is possible to
clear this text box or add invalid characters (i.e. non-digits). This is not handled and
may result in an error. If this happens, please restart the app.

Also, on lower resolution screens, the bottom of some of the slides may not appear. And in
the shiny app, it may be necessary to scroll to see the "Run Simulation" button.
