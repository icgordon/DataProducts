Final version of the R files for the Shiny app and for the Rpres presentation.

You can find the published slides at http://rpubs.com/icgordon/87068 and the shiny app at
http://icgordon.shinyapps.io/DataProducts

There may be some display problems with IE on lower resolution monitors. In testing, I have
noticed that the up/down buttons in the IQ text box do not appear. Also, it is possible to
clear this text box or add invalid characters (i.e. non-digits). This is not handled and
may result in an error. If this happens, please restart the app.

In further testing, I found that the Rpres slides do not want to load when using IE 9 with
Windows 7. It does open fine with Firefox and probably also with Chrome. The Shiny app
runs under IE 9 (but some of the controls (e.g. the up/down arrows in the text input box)
do not appear. The slides load in IE 11 but the shinyapp seems to not load.

Also, on lower resolution screens, the bottom of some of the slides may not appear. And in
the shiny app, it may be necessary to scroll to see the "Run Simulation" button.
