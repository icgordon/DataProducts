Final version of the R files for the Shiny app and for the Rpres presentation.

You can find the published slides at http://rpubs.com/icgordon/87484 and the shiny app at
http://icgordon.shinyapps.io/DataProducts

Please note that, if you are using Windows, Rpresentations is only supported in Internet
Explorer 10+. Also, there seem to be some incompatabilities with IE. In the TextBox control,
the up/down controls do not appear. This changes the behaviour of the control.

Also, on lower resolution screens, the bottom of some of the slides may not appear. And in
the shiny app, it may be necessary to scroll to see the "Run Simulation" button.
